This page hosts the R code underlying the "Ivy" app distributed with the following paper:

[Westfall, J., & Yarkoni, T. (2016). Statistically controlling for confounding constructs is harder than you think. PloS one, 11(3), e0152719.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152719)

This code relies on the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) library. To run the app locally, you will need to download the R script files, install the Shiny library, and point Shiny to the R scripts. A nice tutorial can be found [here](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/).
